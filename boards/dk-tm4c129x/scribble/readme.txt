Scribble Pad

The scribble pad provides a drawing area on the screen.  Touching the
screen will draw onto the drawing area using a selection of fundamental
colors (in other words, the seven colors produced by the three color
channels being either fully on or fully off).  Each time the screen is
touched to start a new drawing, the drawing area is erased and the next
color is selected.
