Hello World

A very simple ``hello world'' example.  It simply displays ``Hello World!''
on the display and is a starting point for more complicated applications.
This example uses calls to the TivaWare Graphics Library graphics
primitives functions to update the display.  For a similar example using
widgets, please see ``hello_widget''.
